		<p> <span style="color:pink;"> Big wave surfing is a discipline within surfing in which experienced  </span>
		surfers paddle into, or are towed into,
		waves which are at least 20 feet (6.2 m) high,
		on surf boards known as "guns" or towboards.<br>[1] Sizes 
		of the board needed to successfully surf these waves 
		vary by the size of the wave as well as the technique 
		the surfer uses to reach the wave.
		A larger, longer board allows a rider to paddle fast enough
		to catch the wave and has the advantage of being more stable, but it also limits maneuverability and surfing speed
		<p><div>In 1992, big wave surfers such as Buzzy Kerbox, Laird
		<hr>
		Hamilton and Darrick Doerner introduced a cross over sport
		called tow-in surfing.[4] While many riders still</div>
		participate in both sports, they remain very distinct 
		activities. This type of surfing involves being towed into
		<div>massive waves by jet ski, allowing for the speed needed
		to successfully ride. Tow-in surfing also revolutionized board size, allowing surfers to
		<span>trade in their unwieldy 12 ft. boards in favor of light, 7 ft boards that allowed for more 
		speed and easier maneuvrability in waves over 30 ft (10 meters).</div>
		By the end of the 1990s, tow in surfing allowed surfers to ride waves exceeding 50 ft</span>
		(15 meters).
